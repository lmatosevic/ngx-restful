# ngx-restful
> Angular library for easy integration with RESTful APIs.

This package is refactored [ng5-restful](https://github.com/lmatosevic/ng5-restful) in a way to use and support newest Angular 6 and RxJs 6 features.

Minimum required versions of dependencies:
* `@angular/core`: `>=6.0.0`
* `@angular/common`: `>=6.0.0`
* `rxjs`: `>=6.0.0`

## Instalation
Install library into your project using Node package manager (NPM).

```sh
npm install ngx-restful --save
```

## Usage
This library **does not** contains an Angular module with exported components and service, but instead, provides two classes:
* **RestService\<T, E>** - an abstract class which your services need to extend in order to use provided REST methods
* **GenericResponse** - model class that can be returned from custom GET and POST requests performed from RestService (can be replaced with custom model)
* **ResourceResponse** - model class for single resource object with metadata
* **ResourceResponseList** - model class for multiple resource objects with metadata

Using this RESTful pattern classes allows you to follow best practices for transferring and mapping entity objects from server to your client application. 
And also, provides a level of consistency to your Angular application.

### Creating model
Model classes, which represents resource from your REST API, are created in following way:
(Deserialization will be handled by Angular `HttpClient` request library.)

Exmaple typescript model class (models/article.model.ts):
``` javascript
import {ArticleType} from './article-type.model';

export class Article {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    content: string;
    articleType: ArticleType;
    createdBy: string;
    created: Date;
    updated: Date;
}
```

### Implementing service
When model class is implemented, then REST service for that particular resource (model) can be created. 
Create new class as service with Angular annotation @Injectable() which extends RestService, then create constructor
and implement abstract methods getBaseUrlPath(): string and getHttpClient(): HttpClient.
Generic type T represents the resource model in Angular application, type E is the response model from API.

Example typescript service class (services/article.service.ts):
``` javascript
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';
import {Observable, throwError} from 'rxjs';

import {RestService, GenericResponse} from 'ngx-restful';
import {Article} from '../models/article.model';

@Injectable()
export class ArticleService extends RestService<Article, GenericResponse> {

    // Injected HttpClient must be protected visibility
    constructor(protected http: HttpClient) {
        super(http);
    }

    // Override this method.
    // This is relative url path on the same host as the Angular application is served.
    // You can also use full URL path like: http://my.api.com:8080/articles , just make sure
    // that Cross-Origin requests are allowed on that API server.
    getBaseUrlPath(): string {
        return 'api/articles'; 
    }

    // Here you can override handleError method to perform specific actions when error is catched during HTTP request
    // duration. You could also forward error here and handle it when using this service in other components.
    public handleError(error: any): Observable<any> {
        return throwError(error.message || error);
    }
    
    // Optionally, you can perform non-RESTful request using get() or post() methods
    // Returned value is promise of GenericResponse object which is described below.
    public nonRESTfulRequest(articleId: number): Observable<GenericResponse> {
         return this.get<GenericResponse>({id: articleId}, this.getBaseUrlPath() + '/check/article');
    }
}
```

When performing updateOne(), deleteOne(), createOn() or non-RESTful requests using get(), post(), put(), delete() methods
from RestService, then returned value should be provided as Generic type when calling methods, example class could be
GenericResponse which is packed also in this library. GenericResponse contains three fields:
* **success** - _true_ if request was successful, _false_ otherwise
* **message** - Optional message of requested result from server
* **data** - map with custom values in format: _key -> value_

It's structure is following:
``` javascript
export class GenericResponse {
    success: boolean;
    message: string;
    data: Map<string, string> = new Map();
}
```

Also, since version 1.3.0 the two new generic responses have been introduced:
* For single resource response with metadata:
``` javascript
export class ResourceResponse<T> {
    success: boolean;
    message: string;
    data: T;
}
```

* For the array of resources response with metadata for pagination:
``` javascript
export class ResourceResponseList<T> {
    success: boolean;
    message: string;
    total_count: number;
    total_pages: number;
    result_count: number;
    data: Array<T> = [];
}
```

### Interacting with API
To use your newly created and implemented service, just inject service into the Angular @Component's constructor
and use it as follows:
``` javascript
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
import {GenericResponse} from 'ngx-restful';

import {ArticleService} from '../services/article.service';
import {Article} from '../models/article.model';

@Component({
    moduleId: module.id,
    selector: 'article',
    templateUrl: 'article.component.html'
})
export class ArticleComponent implements OnInit {
    private articles: Article[] = [];
    private article: Article;
    private newArticle: Article = new Article();

    constructor(private articleService: ArticleService) {
    }
    
    ngOnInit(): void {
        // Get all articles
        this.articleService.getAll().subscribe((articles: Article[]) => {
            this.articles = articles;
        });
        
        // Query articles with URL parameters
        this.articleService.query({params: {typeId: 3, page: 1, limit: 10}}).subscribe((articles: Article[]) => {
            this.articles = articles;
        });

        // Get full response object
        this.articleService.getResponse({params: {page: 1, limit: 10, order: 'desc'}}).subscribe((response: HttpResponse<Article>) => {
            if (response.success) {
                console.log("Total items: " + response.data.get('total');
                this.articles = response.data.get('items');
            }
        });
        
        // Get one article with provided id
        this.articleService.getOne(5).subscribe((article: Article) => {
            this.article = article;
        });
        
        // Create new article with provided article model object
        this.articleService.createOne(this.newArticle).subscribe((response: GenericResponse) => {
            if (response.success) {
                console.log("Article created! Message: " + response.message);
                console.log("New article id is: " + response.data.get('id');
            } else {
                console.log("Failed creating article");
            }
        });
        
        // Update one article with provided article model object which must have id
        this.articleService.updateOne(this.article).subscribe((response: GenericResponse) => {
            if (response.success) {
                console.log("Article updated! Message: " + response.message);
            } else {
                console.log("Failed updating article");
            }
        });
        
        // Delete one article with provided id
        this.articleService.deleteOne(this.article.id).subscribe((response: GenericResponse) => {
            if (response.success) {
                console.log("Article deleted! Message: " + response.message);
            } else {
                console.log("Failed deleting article");
            }
        });
        
        // Custom service request
        this.articleService.nonRESTfulRequest(this.article.id).subscribe((response: GenericResponse) => {
            if (response.success) {
                console.log("Request successful! Message: " + response.message);
                console.log("Returned someValue: " + response.data.get('someValue')):
            } else {
                console.log("Request failed");
            }
        });
    }
}
```
